	<p>César Estrada Chávez (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈsesaɾ esˈtɾaða ˈtʃaβes]; also ['sizəɹ ˈtʃavɛz] March 31, 1927 – April 23, 1993) was an American labor leader, community organizer, and Latino American civil rights activist. Along with Dolores Huerta, he co-founded the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA), which later merged to become the United Farm Workers (UFW) labor union. Ideologically, his world-view combined leftist politics with Roman Catholic social teachings. </p>
